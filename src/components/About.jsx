              I am a Junior Front-End Developer with 10+ years experience in
              customer service. After being introduced to coding, I would never
              think solving problem is so satisfying. Iâ€™m passionate about
              continuous learning, growing and improving my skills so that I can
              deliver high-quality code simultaneously.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a motivated team player, I am very much looking forward to be
              part of an experienced, supportive and like-minded team.
